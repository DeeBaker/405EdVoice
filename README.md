What to say?
__I am writing to demand not to confirm DeVos as Secretary of Education. Her hostility towards public education should disqualify her from this position. In addition, she is unqualified because of her lack experience with public education and displays a lack of knowledge and preparation for this position. We need someone that supports ALL our students.__
 
#### State Budget for Education

What to say: __I'm a concerned educator/parent/citizen. Public Education should be the leveling field for all students regardless of race, immigration status, socioeconomic status, religion, and ability but it is currently under attack federally and locally. Please support Governor Inslee's K-12 plan and oppose the Senate's punitive and reckless proposal which would put our most vulnerable students at an even greater disadvantage. Education is a Civil Right and it is our duty to advocate for all students.__
