### **Dear Senator-**

### **I am writing to you today to ask for your opposition to HJR 69, which would allow the shooting or trapping wolves while at their dens with cubs,and also using airplanes to scout for potential grizzly bear targets, trapping bears with wire snares and luring bears with food to get a point-blank kill.**
### **There are a number of issues with this- cruelty, lack of control on kill number s which could lead to a destabiliztion of the ecosystem. With the arctic already under pressure, it is imperative that we do everything we can to help our FEDERAL wildlife refuges.**
### **Thank you-**

### Education
 
#### State Budget for Education

What to say: __I'm a concerned educator/parent/citizen. Public Education should be the leveling field for all students regardless of race, immigration status, socioeconomic status, religion, and ability but it is currently under attack federally and locally. Please support Governor Inslee's K-12 plan and oppose the Senate's punitive and reckless proposal which would put our most vulnerable students at an even greater disadvantage. Education is a Civil Right and it is our duty to advocate for all students.__
